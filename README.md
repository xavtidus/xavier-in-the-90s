A 90s themed website for Static Web Hosting exersizes

The intention of this site is to give you an easy to use / deploy static website when learning how to host static websites in the cloud.

I don't pretend to claim to own logos / images in this code. Frankly I think most of the companies don't exist anymore and the ones that do would laugh and not care. If my assumption is wrong, please contact me!
